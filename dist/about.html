                </h3>
                <p>Hello! I have been actively learning how to code in my spare time since November of 2016.</p>
                <p>My coding journey began with Codecademy, where I learned HTML/CSS. From there I found Free Code
                    Camp, where I earned the Front End Development Certification. I took a few classes from Code
                    School, then completed Colt Steele’s
                    Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy, where I built a full-service web application utilizing Node.js,
                    Express.js, Passport.js, MongoDB, and deployed it with Heroku.</p>
                <p>I continued my server-side education with C# from Microsoft Virtual Academy and completed the
                    beginner course. In January of 2018 I received the Grow With Google Udacity Scholarship and quickly
                    completed their Phase 1 course.
                    I am currently using MVA to learn ASP.NET Core 2.0. React and MySQL are on deck!</p>
                <p>Coding is AWESOME! I love learning new technologies and creating sweet projects. When I am in the
                    zone, I am so focused on solving the problems and getting the job done that everything else falls
                    away. It’s pure flow!</p>
                <p>I am eagerly looking for a position as a Developer with a great company. Take me on, and together we
                    will build many amazing things!
                </p>
